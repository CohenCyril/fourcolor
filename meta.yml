  Mechanization of the Four Color Theorem in Coq

description: |-
  This library contains a formal proof of the Four Color Theorem in Coq,
  along with the theories needed to support stating and then proving the Theorem.
  This includes an axiomatization of the setoid of classical real numbers,
  basic plane topology definitions, and a theory of combinatorial hypermaps.

  ## Documentation

  The [Four Color Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem) (Appel & Haken, 1976) is a landmark result of graph theory.

  The formal proof is based on the [Mathematical Components](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp) library.
